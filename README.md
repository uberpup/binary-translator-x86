# binary-translator-x86
Binary translator from self-written simple CPU to x86-architecture ELF-executable.  
Having the compiled binary for self-written CPU, the translator has to parse the opcodes
and to xreate the binary with each opcode rewritten to its x86 equivalent.  
File also has to be formatted to ELF-executable, which means it has to consist of both ELF-header and program header.  
To check the work asm-binary has to be executed.  
*Work in progress..*
